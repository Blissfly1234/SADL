Creating a ConsoleIO Object

In order to create a connection to the console you need to create the ConsoleIO object. To do this, simply put:

consoleIO console;

You may change "console" to the name of your choise, but for this demistration we will be using "console".


getLine

The getLine() function is the biggest function here. It allows you to get the whole input line without losing any data.
It returns a string and does not edit the data in any way. The String header file is also built into the ConsoleIO header 
file.

std::string String = console.getLine();


Other Get Commands

The other Get commands will return their respected types. there is getBool(), getChar(), getShort(), getInt(), getLong(), 
getFloat() and getDouble(). Each will promt the user for their respected types, and if it fails will set the FAIL flag
to true.

getBool() will take in yes, Yes, no, No, true, True, false and False as an input and nothing else.


System Failiar

If the Get commands fail to retreave their respected data, then the FAIL flag will be set to true. The FAIL flag will also
be reset once the next Get command is ran. To retreave the FAIL flag use "console.fail()". This will return true if the 
last Get command failed.


Output:

The ConsoleIO object has an editable string known as "output". This is the Output Buffer and will be read from when you
print. Simply add whatever you want to print to the Output Buffer, and when you are finished and ready to print run
"console.out()". This will print whatever is in "output" then clear it so it is ready for the next output.
